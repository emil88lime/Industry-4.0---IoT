Pilot implementation of application based on CAMUNDA, Eclipse Ditto and Python

Sample code added below. The definitions of the Python code are used mainly as the background for the implementation of the process tasks the worker fetches and locks. Each and every external task from the Camunda workflow representing the business processes runs with the value checks that are being parsed from the Eclipse Ditto Digital Twins with the trigger by the input of the book order.
